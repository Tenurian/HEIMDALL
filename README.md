# HEIMDALL

## Abstract:
In ancient Norse Mythology, Heimdall was the watcher of Asgard and kept a lookout for malicious activity within the nine realms. As DCO-IDM, we must also keep a watchful eye on malicious activity within the networks we are charged with protecting. As such, Heimdall is intended to be a well-trained AI Model designed to monitor network traffic and generate smarter alerts for analysts to conduct threat hunting on.

## Intent:
As mentioned in the abstract, this project is intended to be a well-trained AI model that will ideally be able to monitor network traffic (specifically Security Onion ZEEK logs) and be able to generate alerts on malicious network traffic it observes.

## Getting Started:
TBD
